Draw more distant tiles (larger/lower res at high delta-z)
  - Allow tiles to have dynamic step size (> DX_VAL/DY_VAL)

Load/display model3d models in tiled terrain mode
  - Model Shadow Maps - Fix Scale and Rotations
  - Model LOD - use mesh simplification

Gameplay in tiled terrain mode
  - Dynamic Objects
  - Pickup items
  - Projectile and object collision detection

TT shadows:
  - Use light dir and mesh normal for tree soft shadow
  - Lower res distant shadow map for tiled terrain mode with smooth blend

Indirect lighting magnitude in 6 directions (+/- x,y,z)
  - how to combine sun, moon, sky, and local lighting values?

Cobjs:
  - Place small destroyable physics objects in the scene
  - Bullet physics for movable boxes

In-Game cobjs editor
  - In-game placement/visualization of objects
Plants with low large leaves
  - Can use palm frond texture
Precomputed cube map reflections on specular surfaces (such as the gold dragon)
