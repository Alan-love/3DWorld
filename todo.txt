Draw more distant tiles (larger/lower res at high delta-z)
  - Allow tiles to have dynamic step size (> DX_VAL/DY_VAL)

Load/display model3d models in tiled terrain mode
  - Model Shadow Maps - Fix Scale and Rotations
  - Model LOD - use mesh simplification

Gameplay in tiled terrain mode
  - Dynamic Objects
  - Pickup items
  - Projectile and object collision detection

TT mode biomes control noise exponent
Puffy clouds in tiled terrain mode

Support platform rotate (doors)
SSAO using depth map and postprocessing pass

Local light source shadow maps
  - Light types:
    - Spotlight: single 2D texture
	- Hemisphere (on wall/ceiling): is 2D texture facing away from wall/ceiling okay?
	- Point Light: cube map
	- Line light: skip
  - What fixed/limited set of shader TU ID(s) do we use?
    * Texture Array? Texture atlas? 3D texture?
  - fragment outside light frustum is always lit
