Fix ship collisions
Multiple decid tree impostor orients
Support for cube map textures (planets, etc.)
More grass/plant types: Yellow and white flowers
Hardware tessellation
Vertex Array Objects

Remove deprecated OpenGL calls:
Use triangles instead of quads
 - Tree billboards/leaves
Remove non-shader rendering
Remove usage of gl_TexCoord from shaders and replace with a varying variable
Replace GL matrix operations with something else (GLM?)

Berries on plants
User-placed trees
Laser in smoke
Tiled terrain texture coords on high slopes

Weather/Physics UI
  - key to switch UI modes

User-placed teleporter weapon (translocator?)
Starbase texture
Burning smiley/skull/cobj texture
gen_torus_section rand_gen_t - requires gaussian rand support
Better water splashes (bullet hits, etc.)

Fog color more yellow when looking at side exposed to the sun
More fog in valleys (in morning?)

Increase cloud density when cloudy via shader uniform
Cloud lighting based on thickness/distance to sun
2D cloud noise octaves from different color components of texture

TT Raindrop splashes as white spots in water
TT Foam at water edge using procedural texture when waves are enabled
TT Raise mesh with grass texture to grass height when grass is not drawn

Ray tracer uses specular intensity to randomly choose between specular and diffuse reflection dir
Ray tracer uses cosine of normal for diffuse reflection and specular shine

TT increase near and far clipping distances when the camera is far above the mesh
TT uses lower res source data for distant tiles (far below the player as height increases)
TT Underwater stuff

Smaller universe near clipping plane when close to a planet, or clamp depth
Faster cube mapped sphere planet render
Planet texture width 2x height
Render nearby planet in chunks
Normap map texture for planets instead of storing vertex normals (such as tiled mesh)

Try using Boost in 3DWorld, in particular shared_ptr
