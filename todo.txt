Tile Occlusion?

Smoke texture step size
Indirect lighting normal/direction

Tree space colonization
Tree branch/trunk bark bump maps

Fix ship collisions

More grass/plant types
Leaves on ground (as texture)

Parallax mapping

Tighter textures to reduce fill rate by making the texture tighter (tree leaves)

Removed deprecated OpenGL calls:
Use triangles instead of quads (indexed draw for individual/isolated quads)
Remove immediate mode calls
- Billboard render manager
Remove non-shader rendering

No disable_shaders mode?

Make a backup

Tree billboards use triangles instead of quads
Tree leaves use indexed triangles instead of quads (leaf wind modifies vertices, remove modifies both vertices and indices)

Better dissolve texture using Perlin noise?
