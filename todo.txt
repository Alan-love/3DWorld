TT mode underwater seaweed/grass
Draw more distant tiles (larger/lower res at high delta-z)
  - Allow tiles to have dynamic step size (> DX_VAL/DY_VAL)

Load/display model3d models in tiled terrain mode
  - Model Shadow Maps - Fix Scale and Rotations
  - Model LOD - use mesh simplification

Bindless texture support on Nvidia GPUs: http://developer.download.nvidia.com/opengl/tutorials/bindless_graphics.pdf
More cobj normal maps (mapx cblocks)
Instanced rocks in ground mode - similar to asteroids
Use SDL?
Voxel noise eval on the GPU?
Displacement mapping on asteroids using tess shader
Only load textures during use
