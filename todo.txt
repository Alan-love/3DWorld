Fix ship collisions
Support for cube map textures (planets, etc.)
More grass/plant types: Yellow and white flowers
Hardware tessellation
Vertex Array Objects
Try using Boost in 3DWorld, in particular shared_ptr

Remove deprecated OpenGL calls:
Use triangles instead of quads (Tree billboards/leaves)
Remove non-shader rendering
Remove usage of gl_TexCoord from shaders and replace with a varying variable
Replace GL matrix operations with something else (GLM?)

Berries on plants
Laser in smoke
Tiled terrain texture coords on high slopes
Weather/Physics UI / key to switch UI modes
TT mode underwater content

User-placed teleporter weapon (translocator?)
Starbase texture
Burning smiley/skull/cobj texture
gen_torus_section rand_gen_t - requires gaussian rand support
Better water splashes (bullet hits, etc.)
Set specular for gold/metal materials

Star shader:

Vertex normals for mesh (terrain and water) come from opposite side (+/-) points

More fog in valleys
Fog decreases at high altitude
Cloud lighting based on thickness/distance to sun
TT Foam at water edge using procedural texture when waves are enabled
TT uses lower res source data for distant tiles (far below the player as height increases)

Ray tracer uses cosine of normal for diffuse reflection and specular shine
Ray tracer thread/ray coherence experiments

Perlin noise function experiments

Higher order interpolation functions

Faster cube mapped sphere planet render
Planet texture width 2x height
Render nearby planet in chunks
Normap map texture for planets instead of storing vertex normals (such as tiled mesh)
