Draw more distant tiles (larger/lower res at high delta-z)
  - Allow tiles to have dynamic step size (> DX_VAL/DY_VAL)
TT lower res distant shadow map for tiled terrain mode with smooth blend

Load/display model3d models in tiled terrain mode
  - Model Shadow Maps
    - Fix scaled model shadows

Cities:
- Wider connector roads/intersections
- Railroad tracks
- Fences
* Mesh simplificaton for cars and peds for shadow pass
* Building interior indirect/ambient lighting

* Planet water reflection map
