Fix ship collisions
Support for cube map textures (planets, etc.)
More grass/plant types: Yellow and white flowers
Hardware tessellation
Vertex Array Objects
Texture atlases
Try using Boost in 3DWorld, in particular shared_ptr

Remove deprecated OpenGL calls:
Use triangles instead of quads (Tree billboards/leaves)
Remove non-shader rendering
Remove usage of gl_TexCoord from shaders and replace with a varying variable
Replace GL matrix operations with something else (GLM?)

Berries on plants
Tiled terrain texture coords on high slopes
Weather/Physics UI / key to switch UI modes
TT mode underwater content

User-placed teleporter weapon (translocator?)
* Burning smiley/skull/cobj texture
* Better water splashes (bullet hits, etc.)
Cache the static parts of shadow maps?
* reorder physics/collision/AI to be after rendering static parts of the scene

Star shader: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dXGR4

Fog decreases at high altitude, increases in valleys
  - draw more distant tiles (larger/lower res at high delta-z)
    - Allow tiles to have dynamic step size (> DX_VAL/DY_VAL)

* TT Foam at water edge/wave peaks using procedural texture when waves are enabled

static error check (analysis)
Path tracing dynamic light in Sponza

Raytracing rendering mode
Better pine tree texture

Ray trace test last cobj and use that tmin if intersected
Ray trace use texel color from cobj
Animated smoke texture (smilar to fire and explosion)
