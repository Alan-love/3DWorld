Tile Occlusion?

Smoke texture step size
Indirect lighting normal/direction

Tree branch/trunk bark bump maps

Fix ship collisions

More grass/plant types

Parallax mapping

Tighter plant textures to reduce fill rate
Convert remaining raw textures to jpeg

Removed deprecated OpenGL calls:
Use triangles instead of quads (indexed draw for individual/isolated quads):
 - Tree billboards
 - Tree leaves
Remove immediate mode calls
 - Billboard render manager
Remove non-shader rendering

No disable_shaders mode?

Make a backup

Faster fallen leaf draw

Leaf - Leaf/Branch overlap
