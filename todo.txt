Draw more distant tiles (larger/lower res at high delta-z)
  - Allow tiles to have dynamic step size (> DX_VAL/DY_VAL)
TT lower res distant shadow map for tiled terrain mode with smooth blend

Load/display model3d models in tiled terrain mode
  - Model Shadow Maps
    - Fix scaled model shadows
	- Shadows between different models

TT Projectile and object collision detection
Top-down approximation for sky lighting, similar to rain/snow map

Cities:
- Trucks and other vehicles of different sizes
- Wider connector roads/intersections
- Railroad tracks
