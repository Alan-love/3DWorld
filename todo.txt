Draw more distant tiles (larger/lower res at high delta-z)
  - Allow tiles to have dynamic step size (> DX_VAL/DY_VAL)

Load/display model3d models in tiled terrain mode
  - Model Shadow Maps - Fix Scale and Rotations
  - Model LOD - use mesh simplification

Gameplay in tiled terrain mode
  - Dynamic Objects
  - Pickup items
  - Projectile and object collision detection

TT shadows:
  - Separate tree AO vs. shadows per vertex - use light dir and mesh normal for shadow
  - Lower res distant shadow map for tiled terrain mode with smooth blend

Store indir light weights for 6 directions
