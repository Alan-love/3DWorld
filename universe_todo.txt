Bump map in planet fragment shader using procedural noise

Tile-Based planet surface generation:
* Similar to tiled terrain mode, but with a different noise function,
in 3D, and mapped to a sphere
* Need to decrease ship velocity further when very close to a planet
* Transition must be smooth, including atmosphere rendering
* Evaluate height function at potential collision points (for player
ship, maybe all ships?)
* Not sure what to do with colonies
