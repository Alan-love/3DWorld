Move player ship to planet surface or center in combined_gu mode
Star cross-shaped flare
Planet lights moon
Rings shadow planet
Gas Giant stripes (1D texture?) - all atmosphere
Gas Giants - all atmosphere, no collisions?
craters on planets/moons?
Add lava to hot planets

Clouds glow near the sun (glow map)

Elliptical ship shields

Noise texture per-planet/moon?

Perlin noise for water ripple texture?

Stars: blue = high mass, red = low mass

Use perlin noise for terrain in tiled terrain mode?

Use perlin noise for planets/moons:
* Each planet has generated 3D noise texture
* Vertex height evaluated on CPU for vertices, collision detection,
shadows, etc.
* Detail evaluated in fragment shader based on noise value lookup into
1D color texture
* Use more octaves when closer to planet/moon
* Possible bump map in fragment shader using normals calculated from
noise derivatives

Tile-Based planet surface generation:
* Similar to tiled terrain mode, but with a different noise function,
in 3D, and mapped to a sphere
* Need to decrease ship velocity further when very close to a planet
* Transition must be smooth, including atmosphere rendering
* Evaluate height function at potential collision points (for player
ship, maybe all ships?)
* Not sure what to do with colonies
