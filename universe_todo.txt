gas giant cyclones
craters on planets/moons?

Tighter shadow volume

Use perlin noise for planets/moons:
* Each planet/moon has generated 3D noise texture
* Vertex height evaluated on CPU for vertices, collision detection,
shadows, etc.
* Detail evaluated in fragment shader based on noise value lookup into
1D color texture
* Use more octaves when closer to planet/moon
* Possible bump map in fragment shader using normals calculated from
noise derivatives

Tile-Based planet surface generation:
* Similar to tiled terrain mode, but with a different noise function,
in 3D, and mapped to a sphere
* Need to decrease ship velocity further when very close to a planet
* Transition must be smooth, including atmosphere rendering
* Evaluate height function at potential collision points (for player
ship, maybe all ships?)
* Not sure what to do with colonies
