The biggest issues are 1, 2, 6.

1. [PERFORMANCE] Need to draw multiple passes (shadow/depth + normal render) =>
a) What about textures with alpha test?
b) Skip small objects?

2. [PERFORMANCE] More work and memory access for the fragment shader => but we get
to remove lots of vertices and previous shadow setting code

4. [COMPLEXITY] Every shader (and some fixed pipeline code) will need to use shadow
maps => Update main shaders that already handle shadows (cobjs, grass)
and let the rest use the old/inefficient methods (or no shadows)

6. [ACCURACY] Shadow map needs to be very high res => maybe ok, maybe not - if
not then either use lower res or split into multiple smaller shadow
maps, cascaded, shadow maps, perspective shadow maps, trapezoidal shadow maps
