Shaders:

Completed:
2. Leaf Transparency: VS
9. Snowflakes: GS using billboards
11. Per-Pixel Lighting: FS
12. Infinite Terrain Tiles - Underwater Attenuation: VS
13. Grass Moving in Wind: VS
14. Full Scene Smoke Effects: VS/FS - progressive upload, per-fragment smoke integration with clipping in VS
10a. Fires/Scorch Marks Smoke Effects: VS/FS - see 14

Not Implementable/Too Difficult or Inefficient
1. Leaf Wind: GS - requires state
3. Grass Effects/Regen (crush, burn, cut, update z): GS - requires state
4. Cobj Lighting: VS - too much data sent to GPU per frame
5. Ship Rendering: VS/FS or Geometry Shader - too many shader loads per frame
6. Water Reflections: VS/FS - too inefficient per fragment, too complex per vertex
7. Mesh Texturing: FS - too complex and inefficient, not worth the memor savings (for now)
8. Mesh Underwater Caustics: FS - requires global solution, dependent on other effects
10b. Smoke Puffs Smoke Effects: VS/FS - smoke puffs too large/high fill rate, FS smoke integration too slow

Todo:
10. Smoke/Clouds/Fires/Scorch Marks: VS/FS, or GS using billboards
* Render smoke and cloud particles and/or fires faster or with better
quality/blending/lighting
+ Lots of possibilities here, plenty of research done on this topic
- Not sure what to do yet, or if the improvements would be significant

12b. Terrain Tile Water Env Reflection: VS or FS
* Reflect sun, clouds, and sky
+ More agreement with standard mesh water
+ Better visual quality
- Only clouds in finite mesh mode, inf terrain has fog

15. Planet Cloud Cover (Universe Mode): FS
* Add procedurally generated, unique, animated cloud cover to planets
+ Better quality and more realistic
- Need to figure out procedural noise (generation on GPU or texture)
